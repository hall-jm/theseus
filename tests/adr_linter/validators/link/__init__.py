# FIXME: tests should not write to actual docs/adrs/ for pytests; those files
#        should go to a temporary folder in tests/adr_linter/;
#        see also: tests/adr_linter/post_run/__init__.py,
#                  tests/adr_linter/services/__init__.py;

# TODO: locations for writing these temporary files should be centralized
#       to ensure all pytests behave the same or the exceptions are grouped
#       together for easier review and tracking;
#       see also: tests/adr_linter/post_run/__init__.py,
